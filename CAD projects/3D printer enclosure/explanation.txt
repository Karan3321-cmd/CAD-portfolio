This project involved designing a temperature-regulated enclosure for my 3D printer to improve print quality and reduce defects such as layer banding and elephant-footing caused by uneven cooling. The goal was to create a stable thermal environment during prints.

Key Steps:

- Measured the printer with added clearance for bed travel and moving components.
- Researched commercial enclosures and common temperature-control methods used in enclosed printers.
- Designed an initial fully 3D-printed enclosure, but moved away from it due to poor cost-to-value efficiency.
- Developed V2, using a structural frame with foam-board panels to make it more cost efficent and add more thermal insulation.
- Improved the design in V3, adding a 92 mm exhaust fan and a redesigned opening system, though temperature control remained inconsistent.
- Finalised V4, integrating a temperature sensor and a PWM fan-speed controller to achieve precise manual control of chamber temperature and airflow.
- 3D printed, glued, and plastic-welded components; added foam-board insulation and clear PETG front/top panels for clear visibility during printing.

Potential Future Improvements:
Integrate an Arduino-based control system to connect with a smartphone app, allowing the target temperature to be set automatically with dynamic fan-speed adjustment.

Overall, the enclosure project was highly successful and performs exactly as intended.
