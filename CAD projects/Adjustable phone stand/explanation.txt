This project involved researching existing portable, slim, and adjustable mobile phone stands and integrating their strongest features to develop an improved design.

Key steps included:
- Conducting market research on current products and pricing
- Taking measurements from existing models and creating initial design concepts
- Producing a final design and fabricating it using 3D printing

The stand functioned as intended; however, the hinge mechanism would be significantly more durable if manufactured through injection molding rather than 3D printing.
