This project repurposed an old 10.1-inch tablet into a secondary display for my laptop setup.
The stand was designed in Onshape and developed through several design iterations.

Key Steps taken:
- Measured the tablet, including bezel and charging-port clearances, and modelled it accurately in CAD.
- Designed the holding mount and stand structure.
- Iterated multiple concepts for a rotation mechanism to enable both portrait and landscape orientations.
- Developed a rod-and-axle hinge providing free rotation with good structural strength.
- Added a slot-and-peg height-adjustment system to the stand.
- Estimated the centre of mass using the formula x=​∑Ai​xi/​​∑Ai, to ensure stability and prevent tipping.
- 3D printed and assembled the components using superglue and plastic welding (soldering iron) for added strength.

Lessons Learned:
A sealed air cavity in the stand made height adjustment difficult.
An air-relief hole was added in the 3D printed part to resolve this issue.

Overall, the project was successful, functional, and continues to work reliably.
