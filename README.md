## **Karan – CAD Portfolio**



Welcome to my Engineering CAD portfolio.  

This repository showcases a collection of my design, modelling, and prototyping work created using Onshape, and Fusion 360.
Projects include mechanical assemblies, functional components, rapid prototypes, and various engineering design challenges.

### **About Me**



I am a B. Eng Mechanical \& Design Engineering student with hands-on experience in:


\- CAD modelling (Onshape, Fusion 360, Siemens NX)

\- CNC machining, laser cutting, 3D printing (FDM)

\- Product design and rapid prototyping

\- Engineering drawings \& GD\&T (basic)

\- Mechanical design principles and DFM


I enjoy solving real world engineering problems and building functional designs that can be manufactured.

### **Portfolio Contents**



This repository contains:


\- Screenshots of CAD models

\- Real world Pictures (some projects)

\- a .stl file for each model's final assembly

\- An explanation.txt file in each folder with basic functional explanations of each project

\- A Technical Drawings folder showcasing my engineering drawing skills


You can browse each project in its own folder.
